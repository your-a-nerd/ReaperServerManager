Support Discord: https://discord.gg/zzXU75KjsW

Setup:<br>
1.) Invite the bot to your server https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=852998301446832148&scope=bot&permissions=8<br>
2.) Download installer.exe<br>
3.) Place the exe file in your servers main folder<br>
4.) Run the exe (may need to be ran as Administrator)<br>
5.) Go to the install URL it gives you and fill out the required felids<br>
6.) After that your server should start up. Note every time you restart your server fully use the installer.exe to run your server.

FAQ:<br>
Why do I need to run an EXE file for setup? The main reason is that the EXE file actually runs your server that way you can start, stop, restart, and execute commands to your server from the panel.
